# Communication Mechanisms for Distributed Systems

{{% import path="reusable/footer.md" %}}

---

## Context

- Distributes systems requires distributed nodes to _communicate_ over the _network_

- So far, we described communication as _"sending messages"_ between nodes...

- ... but how exactly do we _send_ and _receive_ messages?

- Okay, we know from our _networking_ course that __network protocols__ are the answer...
    + e.g. [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)

- But how do we __use__ these protocols in our programs, _in practice_?

---

## Sockets

- Most OS support the [Berkeley **sockets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) API...

- ... and virtually all programming languages provide a _wrapper_ around this API
    + there including Python, via the [`socket` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)

- Sockets are:
    * an _ancient_, and _stable_ __API__ for low-level networking in TCP/UDP (and more)
    * very _didactic_: they require a good understanding of DS fundamentals
        + e.g. client/server, or local/remote dichotomies
    + very _elementary_: higher-level communication abstractions can be built on top of them
        + e.g. RPC, _HTTP_, and virtually any application-level protocol

## Definition

> A socket is an abstract representation for the local endpoint of a network communication path.

### Interpretation

A _process_â€™s gateway towards the network, providing a __full-duplex__,
__multiplexable__, _point-to-point_ or _point-to-*multi*-point_ __communication__ means towards other
processes, _distributed_ over the network

(see next slide)

---

- __distributed processes__: sockets aims at letting processes communicate, so
    * multiple processes on the same machine may communicate via sockets too
    * the same socket on the same machine may be shared among threads

- __communication__: information exchange is explicit
    * data is _sent/received_ via ad-hoc socket methods

- __point-to-point__: each socket mediates the interaction among _two (and only two)_ processes
    * as opposed to __point-to-*multi*point__ communication, a socket may communicate with multiple other processes

- __multiplexable__: multiple independent sockets may be created, on different ports
    * ports are positive 2-bytes integers in the range from $1$ to $2^{16} - 1$,
    * the $1\ldots1023$ range is reserved for well-known protocols
    * ports in the rage $1024\ldots2^{16} - 1$ are for custom usage

- __full-duplex__: exchanged data may flow in both verses, simultaneously
    * i.e. the receiver may send data while receiving
    * i.e. the sender may receive data while sending
