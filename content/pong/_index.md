## Goal

In this running example we are going to

- implement a __distributed__ version of the classic game Pong
- in [Python](https://www.python.org)
- using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org)

in order to exemplify the _development_ of a distributed system _project_.

## What is PyGame?

- **PyGame** is a popular Python library for writing simple games

- It handles many game development tasks, such as _graphics_, _sound_, _time_, and _input management_.

- Simple to use, yet powerful enough to create non-trivial games

- Lightweight, portable, and easy to install
    + `pip install pygame` (better to use a virtual environment)

## Preliminaries

# The Game Loop

---

## What is a Game Loop?

- A **game loop** is the main logic cycle of most video-games

- It continuously runs while the game is active, managing the following aspects:
    1. **Processing user input** (e.g., keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
    2. **Updating the game state** (e.g., moving objects in the virtual space)
    3. **Rendering the game** (e.g., drawing the game world on the screen)
    4. **Simulating the passage of time** in the game (e.g., moving objects even in absence of inputs)

- Most commonly, some _wait_ is introduced at the end of each cycle 
    + to control the game's frame rate

#### Aspects to notice (cf. [PyGame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html)):

- PyGame comes with a notion of _events_ and __event queue__ 
    * this is good for handling user _inputs_

- each event had a _type_ (e.g., `pygame.KEYDOWN` and `pygame.KEYUP`) and _attributes_ (e.g., `event.key`)
    * there is a _class_ for events, namely `pygame.event.Event`
    * event _types_ are indeed `int`egers

- events can be _retrieved_ from the queue (e.g., `pygame.event.get([RELEVANT_TYPES])`)...
    * where `RELEVANT_TYPES` is a _list_ of event _types_ to be retrieved

- ... and possibly _provoked_ (i.e. appended to the queue) by the programmer (e.g., `pygame.event.post(event)`)
    * where `event` is an instance of `pygame.event.Event`

---

## Clean Code Recommendations

1. Better to explicitly represent _game objects_ in the code
    - __Game Object__ $\approx$ any entity that may appear in the game world (e.g. the circle)
        + interesting aspects: _size_, _position_ , _speed_, _name_, etc.
        + may have methods to _update_ its state
    - the _overall_ **game state** consists of _all_ game objects therein contained
        + $\Rightarrow$ update the game $\equiv$ update _each_ game objects
    - cf. [PyGame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

## Clean Code Recommendations

2. Better to explicitly represent _input handlers_ and _controllers_ in the code
    - __Input Handler__ $\approx$ any entity that may _interpret_ user inputs and map them to _game events_
        + supports plugging in different _key maps_
    - __Game Events__ $\approx$ represent _actions_ that make sense for game objects
        + e.g., `MOVE_UP`, `MOVE_DOWN`, `STOP`, etc.
        + custom event _types_ can be defined via [`pygame.event.custom_type()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.custom_type)
    - __Controller__ $\approx$ any entity that may _interpret_ game events and _update_ the game state accordingly

## Clean Code Recommendations

3. Better to delegate _rendering_ to a dedicated class taking care of the _view_ of the game
    - __View__ $\approx$ any entity that may _draw_ game objects on the screen
        + may have methods to _render_ the game (objects) on the screen

## Clean Code Recommendations

4. Wrap up
    - game loop is now much simplified
    - changes in _input handling_ $\rightarrow$ implement new `InputHandler`
    - changes in _game logic_ $\rightarrow$ implement new `Controller`
    - changes in _visualization_ $\rightarrow$ implement new `View`

# Pong Model

## Let's infer a model from the view (pt. 1)

- a _ball_ that _bounces off_ the paddles and the _walls_

{{% /col %}}

<br>

`Pong` game model comprehends:
1. `GameObject`: _visible_ entity in the game
    - relevant properties: `name`, `position`, `size`, \*`speed`\*, `bounding_box`
        * `position`, `size`, and \*`speed`\* are `Vector2` instances
    - particular cases: `Paddle`, `Ball`
        * `Paddle` instances are assigned to one `side` (_property_) of the screen
            + 4 possible _sides_ for as many `Direction`s: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`
            + each paddle corresponds to a different _player_
                - to support _local_ **multiplayer**, different _key bindings_ are needed
2. `Board`: the plane upon which the game is played (black _rectangle_ in the figure)
    - relevant properties: `size`, `walls`
    - `Wall`: _invisible_ entity that _reflects_ the `Ball` when hit

3. Ancillary classes: `Vector2`, `Rectangle`, `Direction`
    - `Vector2` _utility_ class from PyGame, representing a _2D vector_
    - `Rectangle` _utility_ class, representing a _rectangle_, supporting __collision detection__
    - `Direction` is an _enumeration_ of 4 possible directions + `NONE` (lack of direction)

## Let's infer a model from the view (pt. 4)

Facilities of the `Pong` class, to __configure__ the game:
- `reset_ball(speed=None)`: _re-locates_ the `Ball` at the _center_ of the `Board`, setting its `speed` _vector_ to the given value 
    + _random_ speed _direction_ is provided if `speed` is `None`
- `add_paddle(side, paddle=None)`: _assigns_ a `Paddle` to the `Pong`, at the given `side` (if not already present)
    + the `Paddle` is created from scratch if `paddle` is `None`
        * in this case, the paddle is _centered_ on the `side` of the `Board`
- `paddle(side)`: _retrieves_ the `Paddle` at the given `side`
- `has_paddle(side)`: _checks_ if a `Paddle` is present at the given `side`
- `remove_paddle(side)`: _removes_ the `Paddle` at the given `side`

Facilities of the `Pong` class, to __animate__ the game:
- `update(dt)`: _updates_ the game state, _moving_ the `Ball` and the `Paddles` according to the given time _delta_
    + computes _collisions_ between the `Ball` and the `Paddles` and the `Walls`
        * uses `_handle_collisions` method to the purpose
- `move_paddle(side, direction)`: _moves_ the selected `Paddle` in the given `direction` by setting its `speed` _vector_ accordingly
    + `paddle` can either be an `int` (index of the `Paddle` in the `paddles` list) or a `Direction` (side of the `Paddle`)
    + _left_ and _right_ paddles can only move _up_ and _down_, respectively
    + _up_ and _down_ paddles can only move _left_ and _right_, respectively
- `stop_paddle(side)`: _stops_ the selected `Paddle` from moving

--- 

## About collisions

- _Collision detection_ is a crucial aspect of game development
    + it is the process of _determining_ when two or more game objects _overlap_
    + it is the basis for _physics simulation_ in games

- In `Pong` collisions are very _simple_, as they simply rely on the game objects' __bounding boxes__
    + a _bounding box_ the __minimal__ _rectangle_ that _encloses_ the game object
    + a collision is detected when two bounding boxes _overlap_

- In `Pong` there are 3 sorts of relevant collisions:
    1. `Ball` vs. `Paddle`
    2. `Ball` vs. `Wall`
    3. `Paddle` vs. `Wall`

- __Bouncing__ can simply be achieved by _reversing_ the `Ball`'s speed _vector_ along the _colliding_ axis

---

## Collision detection in `GameObject`s (non overlapping)

---

## Collision detection in `GameObject`s (overlapping)

![](./collision-2.svg)

---

## Collision detection in `GameObject`s (inside)

![](./collision-3.svg)

---

## Bouncing

1. Suppose the `Ball` is close to an obstacle and `update()` is called

![](./bouncing-1.svg)

---

## Bouncing

2. When the position of the `Ball` is updated, it is now _overlapping_ an obstacle (wall, or paddle)

![](./bouncing-2.svg)

---

## Bouncing

3. `Bouncing` = _reversing_ the speed vector along the _colliding_ axis + re-locating the `Ball` outside the obstacle

![](./bouncing-3.svg)

---

## Bouncing

3. Another `update()` call will _move_ the `Ball` _away_ from the obstacle

## Input handling and Control (pt. 1)

In the general case, `Paddle`s are moved by players, via the _keyboard_
+ when players are __distributed__, the _keyboards_ are __different__
    * so __key bindings__ _can_ be the _same_ for all players (but still _customisable_)

+ when players are __local__, there's only __one__ keyboard
    * so __key bindings__ _must_ be _different_ for each player
