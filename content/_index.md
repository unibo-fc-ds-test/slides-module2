## Goals

- Teach you how to __design__ and __develop__ Distributed Systems, in practice...
- ... via a _running example_ (namely, distributed [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong))
- Give you a _reference_ for developing your final __project work__

---

## Topics

- Distributed __architectures__ and __protocols__
- Communication __mechanisms__ (TCP / UDP _sockets_)
- _Presentation_ (__serialization__ and __deseralization__)
- __Issues__ of distributed systems programming
- \[Hopefully\] __Testing__ distributed systems
- \[Hopefully\] Overview on distributed programming __frameworks__ / __libraries__
